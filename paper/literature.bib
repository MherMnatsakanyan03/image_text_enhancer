  abstract = {This paper presents a new document image binarization technique that   segments the text from badly degraded historical document images. The proposed   technique makes use of the image contrast that is defined by the local image   maximum and minimum. Compared with the image gradient, the image contrast   evaluated by the local maximum and minimum has a nice property that it is more   tolerant to the uneven illumination and other types of document degradation such   as smear. Given a historical document image, the proposed technique first   constructs a contrast image and then detects the high contrast image pixels which   usually lie around the text stroke boundary. The document text is then segmented   by using local thresholds that are estimated from the detected high contrast   pixels within a local neighborhood window. The proposed technique has been tested   over the dataset that is used in the recent Document Image Binarization Contest   (DIBCO) 2009. Experiments show its superior performance.},

  abstract = {A new method is presented for adaptive document image binarization,   where the page is considered as a collection of subcomponents such as text,   background and picture. The problems caused by noise, illumination and many source   type-related degradations are addressed. Two new algorithms are applied to   determine a local threshold for each pixel. The performance evaluation of the   algorithm utilizes test images with ground-truth, evaluation metrics for   binarization of textual and synthetic images, and a weight-based ranking procedure   for the final result presentation. The proposed algorithms were tested with images   including different types of document components and degradations. The results   were compared with a number of known techniques in the literature. The   benchmarking results show that the method adapts and performs well in each case   qualitatively and quantitatively.},

  ABSTRACT = {Document image binarization is a challenging task, especially whenit comes to text segmentation in degraded document images. The binarization, asa pre-processing step of Optical Character Recognition (OCR), is one of themost fundamental and commonly used segmentation methods. It separates theforeground text from the background of the document image to facilitatesubsequent image processing. In view of the different degradation degrees ofdocument images, researchers have proposed a variety of solutions. In thispaper, we have summarized some challenges and difficulties in the field ofdocument image binarization. Approximately 60 methods documenting imagebinarization techniques are mentioned, including traditional algorithms anddeep learning-based algorithms. Here, we evaluated the performance of 25 imagebinarization techniques on the H-DIBCO2016 dataset to provide some help forfuture research.},
